This is a highschool student platform that enahes them to get notes on various subjects..

Make sure you create a database in Xampp (Or any other databse) using the topscoredatabase.sql file uploaded to this project

The passwords of the accounts pre-created in the database above are similar to the addmission number used i.e (admno == password )

I did not focus primarly on the media queries, so I used suggest opening the project from a personal computer (pc)

Ensure you have installed all the necessary dependancies ound in package.json file found in t the project.

The MAIN practice of this project was to interact with the API ie...I was able to interact with the sendGrind API
enabling the sending of message to the users email.

The use of json web tokens has also being creatly implemented for additional security purposes..
